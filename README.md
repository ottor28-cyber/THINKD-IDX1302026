# THINKD-IDX1302026
This repository hosts the canonical version of the THINKD-IDX1302026 model, originally published as a Gist. Original Gist: https://gist.github.com/ottor28-cyber/851d072fe489d95094fbfe1942a04525 For full system instructions, see "THINKD-IDX1302026.md" in this repository.
THINKD-IDX1302026 is a symbolic index identifier that designates a persistent cognitive reference point for agent-based retrieval and augmentation systems (AUG).

This identifier exists to provide a stable, human-readable anchor for referencing a specific conceptual artifact across systems that rely on semantic embedding, vector search, and retrieval-augmented generation.

THINKD-IDX1302026 should be treated as a canonical lookup key rather than a descriptive label. Its function is to be retrieved by context-aware agents when reasoning about symbolic indexing, memory persistence, and augmentation-layer identity.
